                    11/24/25 - i learned how to use git, and i made a <a href="https://github.com/kwoshh/kwoshhsite">github repo</a> for this site!! it has all the files and images that
                    are on my computer, so now i can work on the site from anywhere!! it was a little more complicated than i thought at first, but i think i got the hang of it. also
                    the code editor i use, phoenix code, integrates git really well into the software and makes it really easy to use. big shoutout to phoenix code :3
