        <h3>BUYERS OF NEWLY PUBLISHED PARENTING BOOK ANGRY TO DISCOVER THAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT CAT PARENTING</h3>
        <p>11/24/25 - i learned how to use git, and i made a github repo for this site!! it has all the files and images that are on my computer, so now i can work on the site
            from anywhere!! it was a little more complicated than i thought at first, but i think i got the hang of it. also the code editor i use, phoenix code, integrates git
            really well into the software and makes it really easy to use. big shoutout to phoenix code :3</p>

        <h3>CARPENTER FIGURES OUT NEW METHOD FOR MAKING HOMES LOOK FANCIER. "They're called popcorn ceilings for a reason!" SAYS CARPENTER WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF CEILING</h3>
        <p>11/8/25 - i finally made the extra header thing for the comic page. I made the site for the comic a while ago, but the updated home page just hasnt had a link to it
            yet. For clarification, the comic thats gonna be on that page is not mine, i cant draw, its for a friend, so keep an eye out if youre interested. Also changed
            the text alignment of the changelog page because im quirky 🤪</p>

            a section for the comic page, and one for the testing site that i havent used in a while :/
