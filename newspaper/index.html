        <h3>CARPENTER FIGURES OUT NEW METHOD FOR MAKING HOMES LOOK FANCIER. "They're called popcorn ceilings for a reason!" SAYS CARPENTER WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF CEILING</h3>
        <p>11/8/25 - i finally made the extra header thing for the comic page. I made the site for the comic a while ago, but the updated home page just hasnt had a link to it
            yet. For clarification, the comic thats gonna be on that page is not mine, i cant draw, its for a friend, so keep an eye out if youre interested. Also changed
            the text alignment of the changelog page because im quirky 🤪</p>

        <p>10/28/25 - ive officially retired the codehs version of the site. It was just getting too hard to manage two hoster, and having to manage files for both and stuff.
